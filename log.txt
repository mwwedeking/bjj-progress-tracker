This is a log of changes made to AI generated code:

SQL:
- Changed database name from "bjj_progression" to "bjj_progress_tracker"
- Changed "rank" attribute to "currentBelt" because rank is a protected command in MySQL
- Changed "length_seconds" to "length_minutes"

DataProvider:
- Had to import: import java.sql.Date;

Refactoring:
- Didn't catch that ChatGPT automatically assumed an attribute in the Roll Object to be lengthSeconds... 
This had to be refactored across the Roll class and DataProvider to lengthMinutes etc.
